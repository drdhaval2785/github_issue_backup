  "body": "This issue is devoted to spelling corrections in the PD dictionary .\r\n\r\nThere are 1171 cases, comprising headwords where:\r\n* faultfinder found spelling differences from headwords of MW, and\r\n* spelling difference was not of the 'rxx' variety, and\r\n* headword appears in sanhw1.txt list only for PD dictionary,\r\n\r\nSince 1171 cases is a rather large number to manually check, a further programmatic examination was made.\r\nThere are many headwords among the 1171 which are compounds; if we can identify a given case as a\r\ncompound, then that case is likely  to be correctly spelled.\r\n\r\nA program was devised to catch some of these compounds; the program identifies 724 as compounds,\r\nthus leaving 435 cases unexplained, to be examined further by reference to scanned image.\r\n\r\nHere are materials prepared: \r\n* [pd-cpd.html](http://funderburkjim.github.io/fuzzywork/pd-cpd.html) shows the analysis into compounds \r\n* [pd-cpd.txt](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PD/faultfinder/pd-cpd.txt)\r\n* [pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.html](http://funderburkjim.github.io/fuzzywork/pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.html) provides links and fuzzyalpha suggestions for the 435 cases that need hand examination.  Probably, the\r\nsuggestions won't be very useful.  Also, it is anticipated that only a small number of cases will actually be\r\nspelling errors.\r\n* [pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.txt](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PD/faultfinder/pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.txt) is the text version of the 435 cases that need examination.\r\n\r\n[Issue#100](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/100) describes the method expected to be used in processing the *not_cpd* cases.\r\n",
