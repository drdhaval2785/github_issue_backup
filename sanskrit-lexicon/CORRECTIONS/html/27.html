<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/27" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/27</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - MW - Drawing attention to potentinal errors in addendum</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>While submitting corrections at #2 I was surprised to see that the errors were far greater in number in the additional entries which MW added after page 1300 or so.<br/>It would be a good idea if @Shalu411 can have a look at all the entries in that additional section and draw attention to corrections. @gasyoun may also like to contribute<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 It's good that you noted down that the quality of the addenda input is potentially lower. But that is quite plenty of pages I guess we'll need to wait for that a bit longer. So the frequency of errors seems to be much higher right?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun Github has enough space.<br/>The issue may wait till we have volunteers.<br/>But thought that I should share the observation which I made while doing #2. <br/>Nothing of urgent sort</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I concur with this observation.  <br/>Here is a bit of history regarding the MW supplement.<br/><br/>These additions/corrections records were originally in a separately digitized file MONIER.ADD from Thomas. This file is about 400k.<br/><br/>They were 'tacked on the end'  (With Lnumbers 300000-399999) of monier.xml in 2010.  This also involved converting the form from that of MONIER.ADD to that of monier.xml.  I probably did this.<br/><br/><br/>in 2012  work by Peter Scharf Pawan Goyal and Sharon Ben-Dor (a former student of Peter) permitted the integration of the supplement into the body of monier.xml.  Essentially this involved identifying &lt;Hx&gt; codes and appropriate new Lnumbers for the supplement records. The coding was done in such a way that it is possible to identify records that originated in the supplement.  As I recall this is by means of an attribute of the Lnumber element.<br/><br/>Thus it is likely possible to extract in supplement order the records of mw.xml that originated from the supplement.  Then someone could read these records in relation to the scans.  <br/>I count 6602 records in mw.xml matching '&lt;L ' ; 6397 of these are of form &lt;L supL=\X\&gt;  and the rest are &lt;L revL=\X\&gt;  indicating supplements (additions) and revisions respectively. There about 25.5 scan pages involved.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Jim always interesting to hear another story how it all begun. Will you extract or should I?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim good to know the background story.<br/>25 pages would not be a lot of work.<br/>Let us wait for a volunteer who can do this.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim seems busy. <br/>@gasyoun you are now relatively free.<br/>Extract the list please.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Not yet red tape issues regarding my PhD are still not over. You want all `L supL=\X\` records and that's all?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>There are two forms of L that indicate a records from the supplement:<br/>```<br/><L supL=\X\>Y</L>   supplement (i.e. addition new word)<br/><L revL=\X\>Y</L>    revision  (change some detail of word already in body)<br/><br/>(Incidentally 'X' is the FORMER L-number; before the supplement records were woven into<br/> the body of mw.xml they all appeared 'at the end'; the at-the-end L-number is X. Currently <br/>X is not of interest but it was of interest while the interweaving process was active.<br/>However if you wanted to make a list in the order of the print edition supplement then you <br/>would sort on X.)<br/>```<br/>By filtering mw.xml  using regex \&lt;L \    (L with space) you get exactly  the set of MW records in the supplement.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>`<L ` advice is of great help thanks. I guess the print order is not of big use anymore in this case. @drdhaval2785 please see <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/blob/master/6602-entries-from-supplements-MW.txt" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/blob/master/6602-entries-from-supplements-MW.txt</a></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>The print order would be of use if someone wanted to tackle the task of comparing the digitization to the print.  I can't  determine if the 6602-entries-from-supplpements-MW.txt is ordered by the supplement L-number but it would be easy to so order the file if needed.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>I don't intend to use the xml data.<br/>I am bad at extracting things.<br/>Right now I need only headword list (with a hyperlink to the MW digitised version).<br/>e.g. [Davala](<a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=Davala&input=slp1&output=SktDevaUnicode)" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=Davala&input=slp1&output=SktDevaUnicode)</a></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Hyperlinked headword list based on 6602-entries-from-supplpements-MW.txt?</p><hr/></body></html>
