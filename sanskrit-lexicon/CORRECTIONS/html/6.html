The difference is that final 'a'.  MW does have this (as SAla...Aya).  Both PW and MW are denominative verb forms.  I think that final 'a' is  just a difference in convention between PW and MW regarding the citation of a denominative verb.  Conclusion : Leave PW as it is in this case.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>It indeed seems to be a convention followed by PW.<br/>I searched for suffix 'Ay' in PW.<br/>It gave me this which clearly shows that there are 469 occurrences of 'Ay' at end with our friend 'SAliBaYjikAy' as one of them.<br/>It would be criminal to change only this entry and leave others.<br/>I agree with Jim that it should be kept as it is because it is internally consistent with scan and other entries as well.<br/>![capture](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153024/6615ffc8-7236-11e4-89a1-6f87e456ea16.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153024/6615ffc8-7236-11e4-89a1-6f87e456ea16.PNG)</a><br/></p><hr/></body></html>
