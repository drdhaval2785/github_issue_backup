If you would be able to make a video I would be able to learn and become 5 g smarter.<br/><br/>To have both<br/>```<br/>sUpodanazazWIpUjA:PW f.  Titel<br/>sUpOdanazazWIpUjA:MW f. N. of wk.<br/>```<br/>seems fishy to me.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 do you agree?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>I agree. But why only 'o' vs 'O'. <br/>Let us try to compare the words which are different only in terms of Capitals.<br/>e.g. 'e'-'E' 'o'-'O' 'a'-'A' etc.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 I agree sure.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Trying for it.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Currently developing a comparision text based on sanhw1.txt.<br/>Not cleaned one.<br/>The same old unclean one.<br/><br/>Logic for filtering the words are as below:<br/>1. The case insensitive comparision should be 100% (strcasecmp($a1$a2)===0<br/>2. both words should not be identical ($a1!==$a2)<br/>3. None of the dictionary should be Pune Dictionary ($dict1!==\PD\ and $dict2!==\PD\). The reason behind removing this dictionary is that it has a long list of words starting with 'a'. Gives a lot of false positives.<br/>4. The words are not from the same dictionary ($a1$a2 don't belong to the same dictionary)<br/>5. The last words are not aAmM and the difference is not in the last letter only. (to accommodate for musculine/feminine and m/M ending issues).<br/><br/>We are taking a bunch of 10000 words from sanhw1 and comparing each against 9999.<br/>The reason behind taking 10000 bunch is to minimize the time because comparing 1 word against 400000 odd words would be too computationally heavy.<br/>Therefore 10000 seem fine for comparision.<br/>As the words confused by the 'o'/'O' etc in the middle would have the same starting pattern there are very less chances of missing some important catch by taking 10000 batch.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>The raw text file is available at <a href="https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/blob/master/o_vs_O.txt." target="_blank">https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/blob/master/o_vs_O.txt.</a><br/><br/>The data is culled from sanhw1.txt using <a href="https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/blob/master/o_vs_O.php." target="_blank">https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/blob/master/o_vs_O.php.</a><br/><br/>The format is in the following format.<br/>Word1:Word2 - Dict1:Dict2 <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Great.

[Incidentally I'm not sure how or if homonyms will be handled - probably best to ignore at first.]<br/><br/>Thus I will likely want to recreate your filtered lists using such an enhanced sanhw1.  So probably I would make<br/>minor adjustments to o_vs_O.php to read and write these pairs<br/>a similar adjustment to dictsorting to read these pairs and an additional enhancement to<br/>  generate page-links from the dictionarypage information .<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim homonyms best be ignored indeed. There is one concern. If we wait for end of faultfinder we might lost 3-4 months of valuable time. @Shalu411 might want to help on day. The question is how to help her help us. If `धव्हल->धवल` format is ok for Jim before he plans to do the needed adjustments (which might come in Autumn 2015) we could start testing not loosing time in parallel.<br/>ईLइत conversion issues are still around Dhaval is aware of them.<br/>SLP1 part in the reference file <a href="http://drdhaval2785.github.io/o_vs_O/output1/MW.html" target="_blank">http://drdhaval2785.github.io/o_vs_O/output1/MW.html</a> is mostly needed for Jim. But it helps me as well - as the capital letters stand out and as there is no bold formatting used to mark the difference there is some practical use of SLP1 in the reference file but indeed it is not needed for .txt where the corrections are made. I hope Jim can take the devanagari files convert them back again to SLP1 and everybody will work productively.<br/>The dancing :dancer: width of columns make me mad. Even if we make the width of content vs abbreviations 50% each they will dance if all the page is not a single table. @drdhaval2785 Maybe make it and add the headers as text inside table cells?<br/>Links in 2nd column are broken `<a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWG%3Cbr%3EScan/?/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=BagavadBaskara&input=slp1&output=SktDevaUnicode`" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWG%3Cbr%3EScan/?/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=BagavadBaskara&input=slp1&output=SktDevaUnicode`</a> for example `भगवद्विलासरत्नावली` case.<br/>After reading `If you see any errors in the dictionary other than the one you are dealing with leave it.` I was thinking that at the header and footer of each of the `o_vs_O/output1/` files we should add interlinking to all the other 33 dictionary o_vs_O files. So I would not have to browse them or download locally just to switch because already I see that starting with one takes me to issues in another which I would not want to delay or forget.

Let me know if otherwise.<br/><br/>This same program can alternatively take a page=PAGE parameter (instead of a key=KEY) parameter.<br/>In fact the key=KEY parameter operates as follows:<br/>* Make a database call to the data for the given DICT and KEY.<br/>* This database call may return 1 or more records each of which has a &lt;pc&gt;PAGE&lt;/pc&gt; element.<br/>   Choose the PAGE from the first of these records then proceed as if the original call had used page=PAGE.<br/> <br/>This program (with the key=KEY) parameter is NOT appropriate if the dictionary has homonyms of KEY on<br/>widely separate pages.
