<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/1" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/1</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - Announcement of correctionform.txt</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>The <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/correctionform.txt" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/correctionform.txt</a> file in this repository gives an accurate public view of the correction submissions and their status.  The plan is to keep this file in sync with the Sanskrit Lexicon Correction Form (Responses) which is where user Correction Form submissions go.<br/><br/>As time goes by the plan is to have similar information about the corrections that get applied to the dictionaries by various processes outside the correction form venu.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>It's called the changelog. Finally good to see it come.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim and @gasyoun <br/>Don't we need to display the changelog link on the cologne website also?<br/>Otherwise nobody other than us will arrive here.<br/>If we can also give link to the correction github page on the front page - there will be increased chances of volunteers.<br/>Alone we have great limitations.<br/><br/>What say?<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785  Please give very specific suggestion as to where you propose link(s) and the wording.<br/> <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>I see that the home page of <a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/</a> now shows github link.<br/>Good to see. Don't know since when it was there. But this is what I asked for.<br/>![capture](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153036/44f0d4de-7237-11e4-9f79-fc09f68d72b1.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153036/44f0d4de-7237-11e4-9f79-fc09f68d72b1.PNG)</a><br/><br/>Can we put dictionary specific links of Github in the place marked with red in all dictionaries also ?<br/>e.g. Link to MW in this case with same message but link it to MW subdirectory of Github.<br/>![capture](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153043/90b1a9b6-7237-11e4-9bf4-b527ee4049c0.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/5153043/90b1a9b6-7237-11e4-9bf4-b527ee4049c0.PNG)</a><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>As an experiment I put a Correction History link on the Advanced Search for CAE:<br/><a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/CAEScan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php." target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/CAEScan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php.</a><br/><br/>@drdhaval2785 Is this what you were meaning?  <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>`Correction History` looks nice but I guess Dhaval would want to see <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues</a> as well.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>```I guess Dhaval would want to see <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues</a> as well.```<br/>Absolutely yes.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun  @drdhaval2785 <br/><br/>This might provide the opportunity for  a good small exercise in using sandev.<br/>The exercise would be for you to modify (on sandev)  CAE/web/webtc2/index.php   so it has just the the form of link(s) you have in mind.  <br/>Then after review I can fold the sandev version into Cologne version.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/><a href="http://dkfsermons.com/cologne/CAE/web/webtc2/index.php" target="_blank">http://dkfsermons.com/cologne/CAE/web/webtc2/index.php</a> is what i meant</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Since GitHub can host static web-sites (<a href="https://pages.github.com/)" target="_blank">https://pages.github.com/)</a>  there can be a site for the<br/>sanskrit-lexicon project.<br/><br/>I suggest we create such a site and link to it from Cologne pages.  The material Dhaval has prepared above would be part of the site. Since @gasyoun has good instincts regarding web page design he should take the lead in maintaining this site.  Once the site design is established we can decide on exactly which page of the site the Corrections-Help link from Cologne should land on.<br/><br/>Regarding number of links per Cologne Page  I think we should stick to just 1 link (to the Github sanskrit-lexicon site).  </p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim make a test page on github based on Dhaval's idea?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun   Yes that was the idea - to make a website at 'sanskrit-lexicon.github.io' and place Dhaval's [todo list for volunteers](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/44)" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/44)</a> material on that<br/>website. The site might also have other uses.<br/><br/>  [Github Pages] (<a href="https://pages.github.com/)" target="_blank">https://pages.github.com/)</a> explains how to start.  In this case I think a 'project site' is what is wanted.  (so it would be called sanskrit-lexicon.github.io).  <br/><br/>The Cologne site would link to that web-site rather than to the repository.  <br/>That was the idea.<br/></p><hr/></body></html>
