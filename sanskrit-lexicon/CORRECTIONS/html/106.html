Probably the<br/>suggestions won't be very useful.  Also it is anticipated that only a small number of cases will actually be<br/>spelling errors.<br/>* [pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.txt](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PD/faultfinder/pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.txt)" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PD/faultfinder/pd-fuzzyalpha_not_cpd.txt)</a> is the text version of the 435 cases that need examination.<br/><br/>[Issue#100](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/100)" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/100)</a> describes the method expected to be used in processing the *not_cpd* cases.<br/></p><hr/></body></html>
