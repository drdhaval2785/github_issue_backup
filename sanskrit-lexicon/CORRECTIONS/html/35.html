More than that - we have already compiled such list for VCP and SKD. No final approval but there is a .xls file made half a year ago. It's a big task to finalize it and no one around to do it. The draft is mine and @Shalu411 had a look at it but it's not a product we can use now.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>OK. Share whatever you have.<br/>@funderburkjim can easily enlist ( ) occurences in headwords.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Sharing what we did with @Shalu411 half a year ago.

Nobody was able to approve or kill them.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Here's my two cents worth.<br/><br/>1. The parentheses appear in what I call  the 'key2' form of the headword.  In all the dictionaries but MW the program hw0.py is responsible for identifying (in the digitization X.txt) the key2 form of the headword. Then the program hw1.py is responsible for analyzing key2 and deducing 'key1'. Thus it is hw1.py which is currently throwing away parenthetical alternates.  And it seems plausible that making use of these alternates would be the responsibility of an enhanced hw1.<br/>As Marcis has discovered interpreting alternate spellings can be tricky - that's mainly why I punted in the current hw1 and did not attempt the task.  Another reason is that I am not clear regarding the appropriate data structures to represent alternate spellings; the solution that was used in MW was less than ideal but it may be easier in the other dictionaries.<br/><br/>2. In terms of priorities it seems premature to tackle the task of alternate headword spellings until we are fairly sure that typographical errors in headwords are few. </p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>So kept in deep freeze till we are OK with headwords corrections.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785  re '...deep freeze...'  That seems right to me</p><hr/></body></html>
