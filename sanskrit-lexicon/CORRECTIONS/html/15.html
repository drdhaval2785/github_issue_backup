<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/15" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/15</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - svArmODna v/s svAmOrDna</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Jim -<br/>Re: 28 svArmODna -> svAmOrDna<br/>Did NOT change.<br/>(a) The text appears to have the 'r' over the 'm' not over the 'Dn'<br/>(b) By alphabetical ordering in PW (using list display) we see<br/>svArdra  svArmODna  svAlakzaRa<br/>So 'svArm...' is correctly placed.<br/><br/>@drdhaval2785 :<br/>Explanation to 28<br/>Please look at the image once again.<br/>I can't read the explanation because of language barrier.<br/>But I can read a sanskrit word -mOrDna at the end of the explanation.<br/>Maybe you should reconsider your view.<br/>The digitization is proper as per print.<br/>But svArmODna is not possible according to grammar.<br/>mOrDna can be derived from mUrDan. So svArmODna is the only legitimate choice.<br/><br/>@funderburkjim :<br/>I agree that -mOrDna is at the end of the explanation.<br/>I don't read German either but using Google Translate can get an idea of the sense.<br/>verdorben == spoiled (Incidentally this seems completely unrelated to mUrDan!)<br/>Vielleicht *mOrDna zu lesen == Perhaps *mOrDna to read.<br/>I also see in the scan at the headword svArmODna and the alphabetical fact is present.<br/>So it seems the author is spelling the headword as given : svArmODna; If we had the reference Kath.1812 that the author had then we might see this spelling.<br/>However with the 'Perhaps to read' statement the author is  in effect agreeing with your analysis of the underlying Sanskrit and saying that maybe it should have been svAmOrDna.<br/>So I'm still not convinced that the headword should be changed.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 <br/>As regarding:<br/>```<br/>The digitization is proper as per print.<br/>But svArmODna is not possible according to grammar.<br/>```<br/>What is in the printed in the real book is of no big importance anymore. We have fixed hundreds of mistakes in the printed book itself by now I guess. So grammar is of much more interest to us.<br/><br/>@funderburkjim <br/>```<br/>verdorben == spoiled (Incidentally this seems completely unrelated to mUrDan!)<br/>Vielleicht *mOrDna zu lesen == Perhaps *mOrDna to read.<br/>```<br/>Is correctly translated. I can read German fairly well. <br/>As per \So I'm still not convinced that the headword should be changed.\ - if there is a ghost-headword `svAmOrDna` than we can (and should) leave the wrong one because the formulation `zu lesen` is equal as statement of it's `fehlerhaft-ness`. So I made a collection <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/PWK-zu-lesen-325.txt" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/PWK-zu-lesen-325.txt</a> - these cases have been noted by Boethlingk himself as potentially bad.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim  any progress in this thread?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I still think the 'bad' spelling of the headword was intentional.  I suspect it was because B&R found this bad spelling in the source Kâṭj.1812 .<br/><br/>Thus I still don't think this headword entry should be changed.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>In looking at Marcis PWK-zu-lesen-325.txt listing  I chose at random the key1 = <br/>amftamati. (so zu lesen)  f.  = अमृतगति.<br/><br/>In this case 'amftagati' is in PW f.  ein best. Metrum.<br/><br/>By contrast for our svArmODna  the implied word svAmOrDna is NOT in PW.<br/><br/>Also for amftamati this compound seems grammatically possible in contrast to svArmODna .<br/><br/>This is just an observation.  Perhaps it suggests some future enhancement.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>What would be a good translation of svAmOrDna ?<br/><br/>Conjecture:  he whose head is in the sky.<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>no idea about the translation. Too vedic type</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>As we could not reach to any conclusive end in this thread let's close this issue. <br/>It seems that the author meant that this is corrupt reading for some word.<br/>We can't expect standards of grammar to be retained in corrupt reading.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>The question would be solved if we compile a list of words of intentionally corrupted reading.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>entering from one tricky question to another. Best luck jim.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>One additional thought on rereading this discussion:   Just as with odd words in MW  it would be useful for PW also to have a taxonomy  (implemented via markup) that would take into account such 'false readings' as this word seems to be.  Implementing such a taxonomy is  probably beyond us now but we may get ideas for the scope of a lexical taxonomy by considering such cases is svArmODna .</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>I guess there is no better time to start \Implementing such a taxonomy is probably beyond us now\ as now. Let's invent the tag and if we have at least a single word marked that's a way to start. Otherwise will never get there I guess.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim something like `<corrupt>`.</p><hr/></body></html>
