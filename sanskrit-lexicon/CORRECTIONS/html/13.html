If so that is the mw.xml convention (the new convention). The only place the old convention occurs is in monier.xml.\ is easily understandable and very fine standard. By far better than the old one.<br/>Have you opened the link I provided? If so you would have seen the <a href=\<a href="http://gasyoun.github.io/reverse20-ouput/key2/devanagarisorted3.html\" target="_blank">http://gasyoun.github.io/reverse20-ouput/key2/devanagarisorted3.html\</a>>reversed list</a>. Everything that contains a number is an issue and I need to find a way to kill all the numbers to find out why they are there at all.<br/>\The underlying slp1 is kfzRO/ for key2 and you see how the '/' displays as a little vertical bar over the Devanagari for 'O' - in particular there is no '/' in the devanagari. Of course you may have intentionally left the '/' in the Devanagari for simplifying analysis.\ means that after converting \slp1 is `kfzRO/` for key2\ to IAST (as per <a href="https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSorting/issues/16)" target="_blank">https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSorting/issues/16)</a> I will get `kṛṣṅáu` and the Hex numbers will be gone? If there would be only a few of them I guess so but there are plenty that is why I ask if you might now what could they mean and where they are from.<br/>I want to have a clean list of reversed key2 entries from MW in IAST. Next step is to add the `lexgram` data but for that there needs to be a solution to <a href="https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWlexnorm/issues/1" target="_blank">https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWlexnorm/issues/1</a> but you have not yet commented on it so it's stuck. Hope we can make it this week so it can get into my PhD before it gets printed thanks for reading.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Let me explain what is happening here.<br/>It is because I use a strlen function in reverse sorting.<br/>There is a specified string length for some code to be executed.<br/>When there are '/' appearing in between or ends there is one length added.<br/>So instead of /u0935 it is u0935. So json_decode doesnt convert it back to its proper letter.<br/>It is reverse sorting issue and not issue in MW data</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>re 'needs to be a solution to funderburkjim/MWlexnorm#1 but you have not yet commented on it'<br/><br/>I did make a comment on that issue  and added a program in an attempt to address what I thought was your issue.
