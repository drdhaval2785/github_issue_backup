<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/41" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/41</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - Correction Status Date Format</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>We are all glad that now there is a public file of <a href=\<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/correctionform.txt\" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/correctionform.txt\</a>>correction changelog</a>. But as I wanted to build a graph of change made in 2014 I realized that someones uses at least three different formats:<br/>* status =  Corrected Apr 18<br/>* status =  Corrected 11/23/2014<br/>* status =  Corrected Nov 19 2014<br/><br/>None of them is understandable outside US. Because `11/23/2014` over the pond would be written as `23/11/2014`. But any single standard is better than three at once do you agree @funderburkjim ? Thanks.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Yes - standardization is what we are working for.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun  What date format do you suggest?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format</a> The format MM/DD/YY is unique to the United States. Most of Europe uses DD/MM/YY. Japan uses YY/MM/DD. <br/>DD/MM/YYYY. Because most Sanskritists live outside US (Whitney was the last one :) and none live in Japan. I'm no fan of Europe but it makes more logic so I propose DD/MM/YYYY.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>The correction form responses spreadsheet is a Google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoQI5iPSBGwMdEJycVQ2aHZyOC1FTnRRYlY1blY0ekE#gid=0" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoQI5iPSBGwMdEJycVQ2aHZyOC1FTnRRYlY1blY0ekE#gid=0</a><br/><br/>It is on my Google Drive account but I think you have edit rights to it.<br/><br/>The date actually occurs in two columns:<br/>a. Timestamp:   When an entry to this sheet is via the Correction Form  this field is filled in by some automatic process.  e.g. 3/18/2014 14:48:54 .  I don't know what governs this format maybe the fact that the owner (me) of the sheet is in US is why it shows MM/DD/YYYY.  Changing this format is thus likely hard to enforce.<br/><br/>b. Your Email Address.  The format of this field IS controllable and it is the field you have mentioned in your example of inconsistent formats.   I have made this field have the defacto format of <br/>```<br/>user:comment<br/>```<br/><b>user</b>  is what the user fills in for 'Your Email' on the Correction Form.<br/>and I add <b>:comment</b> when the correction is made.   Generally this comment is of the form 'Corrected DATE'.  <br/><br/>1. Please confirm that the date in 'Corrected DATE'  is the date about whose format you are suggesting a change<br/>2. And In light of the autogenerated MM/DD/YYYY in the Timestamp column  do you nonetheless still affirm your preference for DD/MM/YYYY in the 'Your Email Address' field?<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun Need your answers to 1 and 2.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim sorry missed this one.<br/>1) Exactly<br/>2) MM/DD/YYYY is ok if we all are aware of it.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I back-changed the date format in all the now 1400+ correction form responses to MM/DD/YYYY<br/>and will continue with this form in future.<br/></p><hr/></body></html>
