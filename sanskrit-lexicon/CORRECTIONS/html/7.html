My converter's can do harm - because the tags are different and could get lost.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Ever since this issue was raised in Oct 2014 I have made it an objective to convert the base form of each digitization<br/>from HK to SLP1.   By the `base form` of a digitization for dictionary X I mean X.txt.  (e.g. pwg.txt md.txt etc.)<br/>This task has been done for 21 of 36 of the dictionaries (see below) <br/><br/>Let me explaiin a little more using PWG as an example.  <br/>* The original digitization of PWG exists as a text file named pwg_orig.txt.  This is the file as obtained from<br/>   Thomas.  It has at least two features which make it hard to work with:<br/>  * It uses an old encoding for 8-bit ascii characters ~~call~~ called CP1252  (code-page 1252).  <br/>  * Devanagari is coded using the Harvard-Kyoto transliteration<br/>* pwg_orig_utf8.txt converts the cp1252 encoding of extended ascii to the current standard utf8 encoding.<br/>   This is a comparitively straightforward conversion and there is an inverse conversion in order to validate<br/>    that no information loss occurs.<br/>* pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt   Here the coding of Devanagari is converted from HK to SLP1.   This is actually<br/>  what I call the 'base form' of the digitization.  All the corrections we make are 'installed' starting with<br/>  this version<br/>* pwg.txt  is the current corrected form of the dictionary.  It is also in the utf8 encoding and Devanagari<br/>  is coded as SLP1.<br/><br/>The construction of the slp1 base version (pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt) is surprisingly tricky.   The reason is<br/>that there are various minor oddities in the HK coding.  One especially tricky part is the use of the period<br/>punctuation mark in coding of text which is Devanagari.   The period in 'standard' HK and SLP1 is used to<br/>represent the daRqa.  However this period also commonly occurs in the bilingual dictionaries as English<br/>(or German etc.) punctuation.  In some digitizations Thomas has used a vertical bar in Devanagari to <br/>represent the daRqa and a period to represent non-Sanskrit punctuation.  But usually there are <br/>inconsistencies in the use of the period in text marked as Devanagari and this question has to be<br/>addressed.   It is a challenge and makes the construction of the slp1 form non-trivial tedious and non-enjoyable.  That's my excuse for why some<br/>of the dictionaries with HK-coded Devanagari have not been converted to SLP1 yet.<br/><br/>Here's a list where the Devanagari IS converted to SLP1 in the base form  and there is an<br/>x_orig_utf8_slp1.txt form of the dictionary:<br/><br/>```<br/>ACCAP90APBENBORBURCAECCSGSTMCIMDMW72PWGPWSCHSHSSKDWILYAT<br/>```<br/>Here's the list where there is no x_orig_utf8_slp1.txt form:  <br/>```<br/>MWVCP  have slp1 coding. See below<br/>BHSGRASNPSTCVEI  have no Devanagari. All Sanskrit is in AS (Anglicized Sanskrit)<br/><br/>These 4 dictionaries have a small amount of HK coded Devanagari and are a secondary TODO list.<br/>IEGINM Devanagari only in preface PE (26 instances)  PUI (3 instances)<br/><br/>These dictionaries have substantial HK coded Devanagari.  They form the main TODO list.<br/>AEBOPKRMMWEPDPGN<br/>```<br/><br/>* MW   Devanagari is already in SLP1 form.  There are files mw_orig.txt and mw_orig_utf8.txt.<br/>  mw_orig.txt is the form of MW1899 that Thomas provided way back in 2006 when Peter and I<br/>  first became involved in the Cologne Sanskrit-Lexicon project that Thomas began in the 1990s.<br/>  The current reference form for MW is mw.xml.  <br/>* VCP The base form has a different file name: vcp0.txt which is utf8 and has text in SLP1.<br/><br/>Incidentally the x.xml files for all these dictionaries have Devanagari coded as SLP1.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Let me repeat. I'm afraid to ask questions to Jim. Because when he starts to answer it's a new entry in a to-be published Encyclop√¶dia. If not chapter. I hope you understand now Dhaval why I can't do all the tricks and could only add more mess. Jim is scientific from alpha to omega. <br/>1) 21 of 36 since Oct 2014 means we might hope for full SLP1isation by early 2015. Half done in six months as a background task. This is crucial at least in the part that is connected with the headwords although none of the deeper issues comes out at this level.<br/>2) call CP1252 -> called CP1252<br/>danqa -> danda<br/>3) `inverse conversion in order to validate that no information loss occurs` - what script does it?<br/>Did not get pwg.txt how it's different from pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt. I was thinking it is based on the .xml file.<br/>4) `Thomas has used a vertical bar in Devanagari to <br/>represent the danqa and a period to represent non-Sanskrit punctuation` should we keep this practice in the future? What would lessen or pain?<br/>5) Hope that the list of `where there is no x_orig_utf8_slp1.txt` will pass in the order described so get MW VCP AE and PD in a year or so.<br/>6) `base form has a different file name: vcp0.txt` should we unify before it's too late?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>re: what script does inverse conversion?  The script cp1252_to_utf8.py converts from cp1252 to utf8.<br/>The script utf8_to_cp1252.py does the inverse conversion from utf8 to cp1252.<br/><br/>These scripts are part of the xml downloads for each dictionary.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>re 'Did not get pwg.txt how it's different from pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt.'<br/><br/>pwg.txt contains corrections; when you or anyone submits a correction for pwg this correction gets <br/>installed into pwg.txt;  however pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt does not get these corrections.<br/><br/>You could think of pwg.txt as the 'latest version' of pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt.<br/><br/>pwg.xml is created from pwg.txt  (by script make_xml.py).<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Re Thomas use (within coding of Devanagari) of vertical bar for danda and period for English punctuation.<br/><br/>This convention is true in many dictionaries but not all as I recall. <br/><br/>We shouldn't keep this in coding of Devanagari.  Since we have decided to use SLP1 as the coding system<br/>for Devanagari we should follow the SLP1 conventions.  In SLP1 the period represents danda.<br/><br/>But this then leave open the question of how to represent in SLP1 a 'true' period?  The answer I've used<br/>is to take the true periods out of SLP1 -  the  true period is not Devanagari so should not be included as<br/>part of a section of text identified as coding Devanagari.<br/><br/>For instance  suppose we see in a dictionary the English sentence: `The word for dog is ‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç.`<br/>Thomas would typically code this as `The word for dog is {#zvan.#}`  (note period inside {##}).<br/>If in conversion to SLP1 this was coded as `The word for dog is {#Svan.#}`  and if this were then<br/>converted back to Devanagari we would see `The word for dog is ‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡•§` which disagrees with the<br/>original sentence because the period of the original sentence has been treated as a danda.<br/>The solution is to have the SLP1 conversion of the sentence to be `The word for dog is {#Svan#}.`  (i.e. to move the period outside of the scope of the {##} Devanagari delimiters.<br/><br/>This is the approach taken in converting from Thomas' HK coding (e.g. pwg_orig_utf8.txt) to an SLP1<br/>coding (pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt).  This task is accomplished by a script called 'transcode.py' which is<br/>in the convertwork directory of the xml download for pwg.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Re: vcp0 -  Yes I probably should change this file name for the sake of uniformity.  <br/><br/>Re MW:  MW(1899) is the odd man out.  The base form is mw.xml.  There is not likely to be a<br/>mw_orig_utf8_slp1.txt.  Devanagari is coded as SLP1 in mw.xml.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>`true periods out of SLP1 - the true period is not Devanagari so should not be included as<br/>part of a section of text identified as coding Devanagari.` oh so it's where the fun starts. But I understand the concerns and agree. Some RegEx magic in your python scripts will bring Thomas idea to a standard that will be usable in both directions.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>1. Changed name of vcp0.txt to vcp_orig_utf8_slp1.txt so the name of this base form is consistent with others.<br/><br/>2.

For all of the dictionaries the conversion to SLP1 applies not just to the headwords<br/>but to all of the Devanagari coded originally as HK.   So the non-pratipadika forms (as in AP) are not an issue.<br/>The reason it is complicated usually has to do with rather 'trivial' issues like use of non-standard HK (such as<br/>n~ instead of the usual HK J for palatal nasal) and the much trickier issue of 'English' periods in Devanagari.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>The Devanagari in the base form of PD has now been converted to SLP1.  Only three more dictionaries have significant conversions to SLP1 : BOPKRMPGN.

Because you never know ahead what's before you. So actually what you do is nut just conversion it's cleanup and better markup.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>BOP now converted to SLP1.

(The headwords are roots in DAtupAWa form<br/>so for instance 'gamx'):<br/><br/>* In the scan the footnotes are mentioned as a superscript in the body of an entry and the<br/>  text of the footnotes appear at the bottom of a page.  In the digitization the footnote text appears <br/>  within the body of an entry at its place of mention.  This is one factor that obscures a comparison<br/>  between the display and the scans.<br/>* In the scans the body of the entry often has a tabular form.  But the current markup does not<br/>  permit a reconstruction of this tabular form in a display.<br/><br/>Such a task requires input of a Sanskrit Scholar who understands the nature of the information in<br/>this text.<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Not a Sanskrit scholar but someone who understands layout coding.

Recall that if X is one of these dictionaries then Xhw2.txt <br/>consists of the headwords *in SLP1*.  This was true even before this conversion work.  The conversion<br/>work dealt with the Devanagari text in X.txt as Devanagari in X.txt was before SLP1 conversion still represented in the  HK form that Thomas' original digitizations provided.  <br/><br/>Admittedly this was confusing.  At least this one confusion is now removed in the digitizations.<br/><br/>At any rate I definitely agree with the sentiment that *we should finish the headword checking process via<br/>faultfinder* for those dictionaries whose headword-differences generated by faultfinder have not yet been<br/>examined.  These dictionaries are listed in the 'faultfinder TODO(1)' section of [issue 90](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/90)." target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/90).</a>   The dictionary in this list with the largest set of faultfinder candidates is PD.
