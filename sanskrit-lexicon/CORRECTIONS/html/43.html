The Cologne/issues/41 makes a modest proposal of how to begin gathering this knowledge.  <br/><br/>When we have made explicit enough of these specifics  we could develop a simple web interface to sanhw1  to help refine the ideas.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun said:<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the collection of the list there I propose four big groups.<br/><br/>    Indian<br/><br/>    European<br/><br/>    Modern<br/>    <br/>    Older / Bengal<br/><br/>If a dictionary was printed in India in 1850 it has a set of similar conventions. If it's 2004 and we look up the Sanskrit-Catalan dictionary it uses nowadays popular in Europe orthography and ways of writing the dhatus. It might bee too general but so be it. Not sure if the classification has enough of practical meaning.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun and @funderburkjim <br/><br/>I have seen some words in these dictionaries.<br/>Gasyoun's approach seems to be dictionarywise.<br/>I intend to approach this issue problemwise.<br/><br/>e.g. <br/>There are broadly six places where dictionaries diverge as far as headwords are concerned. More can be added if need be.<br/><br/>```<br/>1 Treatment of anusvAra<br/>2 Duplication of letters after 'r' and<br/>3 Convention of writing words which have 't' at end but get converted to 'n' in declention.<br/>4 Whether dictionary show uninflected form or inflected form of word.<br/>5 Convention regarding anusvAra of verb<br/>6 Convention regarding handling 'f' at the end of a word<br/>```<br/><br/>We should group our dictionaries on basis of these parameters. <br/>I will try to note the clusters for each of these 4 group of conventions.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>N.B. - I am using sanhw1.txt as base. Not sure of dictionaries not in them.<br/><br/>```<br/>1 Treatment of anusvAra<br/>```<br/><br/>**Option 1 - Treat them as M when occuring in between a word (other than the cases where the first member of compound ends with m). e.g. `caMcalaM:AP90`**<br/>AP90<br/><br/>**Option 2 - Treat them as fifth letter of each varga when in between a word. e.g. `caYcala`**<br/>APBENBOPBURCAECCSMDMWMW72PWPWGSCHSHSSTCVCPWILYAT<br/><br/>**Option 3 - Use M at the end of a word to denote neuter gender. e.g. `aMSukaM`**<br/>SKDAP90BHSWILPWPWGVCP<br/><br/>**Option 4 - Use M at the end of a word (not to denote neuter gender but to denote avyayas mostly) where 'm' is supposed to be. e.g. `anukAmaM anudiSaM` etc**<br/>YAT<br/><br/>**Option 5 - Treat m as M when occuring in the cases where the first member of compound ends with m. e.g. `saMgIta (sam+gIta)`**<br/>APAP90CAECCSMDMWPWPWGSTC<br/><br/>**Option 6 - Treat m as fifth letter of a varga when occuring in the cases where the first member of compound ends with m. e.g. `saNgIta (sam+gIta)`**<br/>BURMW72SHSVCPWILYATSKD<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim and @gasyoun Once we are OK with understanding this point 1 we move to next.<br/><br/>**The coding implications for options 1 and 2** - <br/>As we can see that the preferred mode is to have fifth letter of each varga (option 2) let's modify the display of AP90 to suit option 2 i.e. If a user enters caYcala in AP90 he should land on caMcalaM data page.<br/><br/>**The coding implications for option 3 and 4**  - <br/>The most preferred mode is to have 'm' at the end of a headword and not 'M'.<br/>Let's change the frontend of the dictionaries in options 3 and 4 so that a person entering 'm' at the end lands on page with 'M' at end. e.g. aMSukam should land on aMSukaM and anukAmam should land on anukAmaM data page.<br/>The second implication is that users usually don't enter inflected forms. They usually enter the base only. e.g. He will enter aMSuka in most probability and never aMSukam. We will have to see what words in dictionaries of options 3 are neuter gender. We can safely code their uninflected counterparts to land on inflected counterparts. e.g. If a user enters aMSuka in SKD he should land on saMSukam page.<br/><br/>**Coding implications of options 5 and 6** -<br/>This is difficult choice to make but I will go for option 6 as default (Because it is virtually impossible to determine mechanically the difference in options 1/2 and 5/6 i.e. whether the M is the end of first word of compound or not. So we will have to stick to 6 which is counterpart of 2).<br/>Set dictionaries having convention 5 to land on them with even fifth letter as input. e.g. If a person enters saNgIta in MW - he should land on saMgIta data page in MW.<br/><br/>Hope I am clear in what I want in this section.<br/>If some dictionaries are missing out flag it up. We will try to locate the conventions in them.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 the approach and classification ploblemwise at the stage is more than enough and is scientific.

Now we have some prepositions which I noted above. Based on this - correction / addition / exception list etc can be worked out by computer. <br/><br/>Let's get started in this precarious but useful area.<br/>What's your vote @gasyoun ?<br/><br/>I give it the highest priority.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>I guess out of top 10 tasks<br/>* normalizing different dictionaries<br/>* correcting individual headwords<br/>both are the most important ones. Because normalizing is a rather big task I would vote for finishing first round of dictionary cleanup first.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Considering Marcis's feedback - I guess we will have to do both side by side.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>How would you handle this case (data from sanhw1.txt):<br/>```<br/>aMS:APAP90BENBOPBURGSTMWMW72PD<br/>aMSa:BENBHSBOPBURCAECCSGRAGSTMDMWMW72PDPWPWGSCHSHSSKDSTCVCPWILYAT<br/>aMSaH:APAP90SKD<br/>```<br/><br/>In WIL there are two entries for aMSa one a verb and one a noun:<br/>```<br/>[L=5] [p= 001]\t.aMSaÂ¦ r. 10th cl.
