<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/92" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/92</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - Missing data in INM</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>There are 89 cases of missing data in the digitization of INM (Index to Names in the Mahabharata by S. Sorensen).   These are detailed [here](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/INM/missing_0001-0099.txt)" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/INM/missing_0001-0099.txt)</a><br/><br/>If anyone wants to tackle these I can supply the fairly simple instructions.  Basically you have to look at<br/>each case and by some means (such as examination of scan or the print version of text) determine what<br/>the missing text should be and input that and your initials in the line **below** the <b>&lt;orig&gt;</b> line in the file above.  When all the corrections are accounted for I have a program to process the adjusted file and install the corrections.<br/><br/>A first glance at a couple of examples suggests that this might be hard from our scans alone; so probably reference to a better-printed paper version will be needed -- but this is just a guess.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>I hardly believe that other printed copies will help. I have none but still in some cases I understand that what we need to do is decipherment using some kind of prior knowledge or logic. In case of missing numbers we need a scholar interested in the Epics who has the printed editions to restore them - that means we need to make a smaller list where the numbers only in paragraphs are missing. Slowly I can look at them to see if I can help at all. Not all cases are hopeless. As you will see in case of `agastya` - it's just some guesswork but the result is 100% correct. What about the scholar with knowledge of Greek - I see a lot of Greek text. Can we approach him can we ask for help?<br/><br/>aSlezA<br/>![004](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764010/02100b1e-cfaa-11e4-9ef5-6ebad58a2b83.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764010/02100b1e-cfaa-11e4-9ef5-6ebad58a2b83.PNG)</a><br/><br/>aSvatTAman<br/>![10](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764015/edef86ae-cfaa-11e4-9b86-83f0737529ae.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764015/edef86ae-cfaa-11e4-9b86-83f0737529ae.PNG)</a><br/><br/>agastya<br/>![016](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764035/01cdf916-cfac-11e4-8041-c91fad86e148.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764035/01cdf916-cfac-11e4-8041-c91fad86e148.PNG)</a><br/><br/> [Footnote: *1) Natus erat cum fratre Vasishtho semine Mitri et Varuni q{??} <br/>Urvaçīm vidissent amore incensorum in urceum profluente (Bṛ{??} <br/>5. 30 ff. see BR.).] <br/><br/> [Footnote: *1) Natus erat cum fratre Vasishtho semine Mitri et Varuni quum nympham<br/>Urvaçīm vidissent amore incensorum in urceum profluente (Bṛhaddevatā<br/>5. 30 ff. see BR.).] <br/><br/>`(Bṛhad-devatā literally means 'a big work dealing with the Vedic deities'.)`</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun   Agree with your solution for Bṛhaddevatā.
