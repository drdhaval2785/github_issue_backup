<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/30" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/30</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - Codes and readme</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim It is high time that the codes used for Cologne dictionaries are made public. From whatever I gathered it seems that there is no one at Cologne to look after these things. You are the only person running the show. Before the know how of how to run the Cologne dictionaries as admin is lost please put it at appropriate repository on Github so that the show may go on in future. Otherwise the codes on Hard disk may die one day with no hope of revival. Github may ensure the dissemination as well as updation of codes by so many interested scholars. What say?<br/>And don't forget to put a readme of how to use the pythons too. So that people don't end up reinventing the wheel and recreating the codes. <br/><br/>With regards<br/>Dhaval</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 I do not think it's a question of \do not forget\. You know yourself on the 2nd year of coding of our php devanagari sorting scripts that the documentation is lagging behind badly. To document it all would take several weeks of documenting only work because screenshots research in books would be wanted. So it's about priorities. If Jim would only document his \dirty laundy\ we would not see not implementation of corrections no new releases no nothing. Just some huge readme files because you know - when Jim documents something it's a Bible that has a changelog on every word added to it and I absolutely adore the approach.<br/>But yes I worry about the Cologne dictionaries as much the more after Malcolm left us. Being realistic we all understand that in 1 or 20 years Jim might consider converting to some other job or better worlds and Cologne could become non-updatable just one more dead Sanskrit resources out there. That is why I created this place. The only thing I ask is to have some `trash` place where everything would be uploaded undocumented as it is now so we would get out clean laundry later with Jim's help out of. House of serpents home of pythons. Nor Peter nor I are coders. But there is Dhaval there will be people to continue the work. That is what worries me a lot indeed. Because the amount of work already put in this work is non comparable to other online efforts on Sanskrit Sanskrit lexicography in special.<br/><br/>Because as James Nye the gatekeeper at <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/" target="_blank">http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/</a> wrote just a few days before:<br/><br/>`Thank you for letting me know about the error.  We will make that change although it may be several months before the corrected data is available for public view.  This is because of our limited staffing.`<br/><br/>And you start valuing Jim's 3 day update implementation cycle a lot for dozens of mistakes when you know there is 6 month cycle out there for a single mistake.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim I second the concern of @gasyoun with full vigour.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim Sorry to pester once again - it is vital importance. </p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Yes I have thought about this issue a lot and agree it is important.  <br/><br/>One partial solution is to make use of the Downloads for each dictionary.  This has much of the critical information required to keep projects alive. The advantage is that you ( @drdhaval2785 and @gasyoun ) can do this now.  <br/><br/>A second partial solution was attempted a month or so ago by Ralph Bunker a computer expert who has long worked with Peter.  He essentially downloaded to a hosted computer all the downloads so all the Cologne displays would be duplicated.  This is good but there is no good way (yet) for him to keep this up to date  Also what he has is probably hidden from general view.<br/><br/>If we count all the scans and pdfs there is probably 50-75GB of space involved (I probably can get a fairly close estimate of this by some program).<br/><br/>Excluding the scans and pdfs  there is probably 3-5GB (100MB of digitizations and code per 30+ dictionaries) of space required.<br/><br/>I've thought about the idea of developing a 'mirror' site at some hosting service (such as AWS Rackspace) that we could all have access to.  There are several obstacles notably lack of sysadmin skills.   Key to such a mirror site would be that it be kept 'in sync' with Cologne.  I would be glad to pay for such a site if I knew technically how to set things up.<br/><br/>Specific practical technically-detailed suggestions are needed to make this a reality.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Let's try this out. If this works maybe we can go ahead with the plan.<br/>Let's host the duplicate of a single dictionary (MW) to some server (demo mode).<br/>Let @gasyoun and me try to update a dictionary error in that demo mode with @funderburkjim's support.<br/>Similarly let us learn to use the codes to keep change log. <br/>As and when the issue arises we will seek your help.<br/>That way we can learn.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Rackspace is fine and my for sysadmin has made mirrors for me before. He knows what and how to do but after the Ukraine war I'm not able to afford his services on a regular basis anymore. Can we ask Ralph Bunker to make a github account and learn each other so that not only Peter is close to him?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun   So you think we should go with Rackspace rather than AWS?  A first glance says that AWS can be started for free but not Rackspace.  So I'm inclined to start with AWS.  Your thoughts?<br/><br/>@drdhaval2785  MW is more complicated to maintain than the others since its primary form is no longer a text file.   So I think the first dictionary to host should be one of the others.  <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>Any dictionary is fine. I leave it to you to choose.<br/>Can't we host on sanskrit-lexicons site itself with some space carved out with link not shown to other population rather than going for AWS or something like that. After all right now we are talking about demo rather than the full setup being transferred to some other place.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>AWS would work as well just fine. I agree with Dhaval - even AWS might be too much right now.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 and @gasyoun :  I've set up a sample on a hosting account and you should receive an email with details.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785 Did you receive the email regarding hosting account login (sandev)?   I want to delete the Dropbox part when you've got it.  I that @gasyoun already has it.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>I didn't get email. Checked even the promotions and social tabs in my inbox.<br/>Nope.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Hi Dhaval -  I resent the email (from Gmail).<br/>One perhaps crucial detail that I noticed was that your email shows as <br/><br/>\Dr. Dhaval Patel\ <notifications@github.com>  <br/><br/>So (a) the (new and resent) email from me could be in your Github notifications or (b) It could have evaporated.<br/><br/>If you don't see the CAE DEMO email from me  it's probably because I don't have a real email address for you.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I'm leaning towards AWS-S3 as a repository for storing a backup of the critical information from Cologne.  <br/><br/>As a first step I've copied scans of three of the dictionaries to AWS-S3.<br/><br/>A [video](<a href="http://youtu.be/LqaxgNaZBxo)" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/LqaxgNaZBxo)</a>  describes the process.<br/><br/>Any comments or suggestions?<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim Thanks for getting there. The fact is the highest priority things have been left out. I would love to see the text document at 9:56 here - as a text document on github. You seem to document everything in a very detailed way. But only part of it is available. Because the video's idea of image backup's is simple but not the python code that does it or your plan. Please bring the up here as well. You keep a changelog of everything including some meta data. It's of interest to at least two more persons.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Absolutely fine approach to shift bulky pdf things to amazon servers and keep only scripts on cologne server. The speed will increase. <br/>And we need to put codes - documented of otherwise to some place of open access. It is need of hour.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Amazon will be gone if nobody will pay for it for a single month so it's not critical Dhaval I guess. Speed was not an issue before was it? It loads nicely.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>A very detailed description of what has been done so far on AWS S3 is [here](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/Cologne/blob/master/awsintro.txt)." target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/Cologne/blob/master/awsintro.txt).</a><br/><br/>I also mention my current intentions though they are not fixed in stone.<br/><br/>It now looks to me that AWS S3 is a good place to store things.  These are under an AWS account that I have and which I intend to continue paying for indefinitely.   <br/><br/>This will not immediately change what is on Cologne.  It is intended to provide a backup to what is on Cologne.  <br/><br/>In the reference above I've indicated (at the bottom) what I intend to put on S3.<br/><br/>At this point nothing is written in stone meaning that I am open to suggestions.<br/><br/>I suggest we continue this discussion as issues in the Cologne repository where the above note resides.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>As you have noted down the possible candidates for storage let me try to add my comments on them.<br/>```<br/>* Plans:<br/>1. Currently my plan is to copy the scans for the other dictionaries to the<br/>s3://sanskrit-lexicon/scans bucket.<br/>I estimate the total space that would be used is about 10GB.<br/>2. I may copy various programs and data as zipped blobs to this bucket:<br/>**Unzipped** the sizes are<br/>a. 2GB all digitizations in 'orig' directories<br/>b. 10GB pywork directories<br/>c. 2GB web directories excluding pdfpages directories.<br/>d. 3GB mwupdate<br/>2a. Alternatively I may try to reorganize the code (since code for<br/>one dictionary A is quite similar (but not identical) to that for<br/>another dictionary B.<br/>3. I haven't decided whether to save backups of certain things:<br/>a. 10GB downloads of bookmarked pdfs<br/>b. 11GB zip downloads (Xtxt.zip Xxml.zip Xweb.zip)<br/>```<br/>1. Fine.<br/>2/2a - Please go for 2 and not 2a. The reason is that whatever minor modifications are there in other dictioaries it will take years to do so for a person other than you. So not an option to go for 2a. Store 2 as it is in Cologne for now. If you reorganise the code and reduce the size do so at a later stage.<br/>3a3b - A good idea to store them also. Otherwise we will have to come all the way to USA to search for your hard drive one day.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>2a sounds interesting but only if there will be a download all button one day. Like a torrent file or a software that's ZIPs everything giving me a huge archive or a series of smaller archives with everything on the site.</p><hr/></body></html>
