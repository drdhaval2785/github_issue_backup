<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/55" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/55</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - £ character in GRA digitization</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>A user submitted a correction under 'id' for Grassman.  It appears (at bottom of a long entry) in displays as:<br/>```<br/>néd = ná£íd siehe für sich.<br/>```<br/>This is at bottom of page 206 of scans:<br/>![image](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/5497605/53e26700-86e1-11e4-9feb-457c832bab19.png)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/5497605/53e26700-86e1-11e4-9feb-457c832bab19.png)</a><br/><br/>The user's suggestion was<br/>```<br/>best would be „ná‿íd“ possible is also „ná_íd“<br/>```<br/>Since I couldn't find the unicode representation for the first option I chose to use the 2nd option which is a simple ascii underscore character.<br/><br/>It happens that £ occurs many times (1000+) in the gra.txt digitization.  A small sample suggests that it always occurs as a separator between vowels in hiatus.  Since the underscore character does NOT occur in gra.txt it is safe to replace £ with _.  At least in Emacs that curved underscore does not show up well (also I don't know what Unicode character it is) so it seems best to use the underscore.<br/><br/>Comments?<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>The user would be the best person to tell what is the unicode character behind it. He may be a native of that language.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Dhaval it's not about a language. Grassman was a German mathematician. I do not like `„ná_íd“` because `_` has a totally different meaning in MW.xml - and I would not want to have 20 meanings for the same character. That is what I call uniformity and we are 1/20 there. `203F` is totally unicode <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/203f/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/203f/index.htm</a> - I would go for it so as the user proposed.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim as suggested by file shared by Marcis it is unicode. Let's go for it.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Can you copy-paste this  `203F` ‿ undertie character in Notepad++ ?<br/>Using Emacs I cannot - it shows up as a box.  <br/>I also had problems pasting it into my usual Thunderbird email client.<br/>However it does paste and display properly here  ( in github) and in gmail.<br/><br/>So there is something 'bleeding edge' about this character that makes me reluctant to use it now.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Using Emacs I cannot - it shows up as a box - it's not about Emacs. It's about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6026713/how-do-i-change-emacs-default-font-size-and-font-type" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6026713/how-do-i-change-emacs-default-font-size-and-font-type</a> - make it a Unicode font like Arial Unicode. No problems at all.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun  Your suggestion was exactly on  target.  Thank you.  The undertie character is now used in GRA.<br/><br/></p><hr/></body></html>
