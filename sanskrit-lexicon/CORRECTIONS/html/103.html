It is a short list and won't take much time.  And it will give you the opportunity to get the technical details worked out.<br/><br/>Basically you are going to 'complete' the pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt file  using the links in pgn-fuzzyalpha.html (mostly the page links) to help you see what's going on.  To 'complete' the .txt file  first download it (right click on link above to pgn-fuzzalpha.txt and 'save as' to a local file).  Then change this local copy and when you're done upload somewhere in the cloud (Dropbox is fine) and mention the link to upload location in a comment in this issue.  I'll grab your corrected file and do the installation on the Cologne server.<br/><br/>As to the format expected in your corrected pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt  see Dhaval's instructions;  you might also <br/>want to look at Dhaval's completed file [vei-fuzzyalpha-completed.txt](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/VEI/vei-fuzzyalpha-completed.txt)." target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/VEI/vei-fuzzyalpha-completed.txt).</a><br/><br/>Lots of little details but not too hard once you've done it once or twice. :sunglasses: <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim it's time I understand as well. Now I do not. :tangerine: <br/><br/>Why some are in () only?<br/>`001 samudragupwa -> (samudragupta)`<br/><br/>Why some () are empty?<br/>`003 SukkraSarmman -> Suklakarmman ()`<br/><br/>Should we have such a big fuzzy distance or just one letter a time would do? Possible correction are taken from different dictionaries or the same?<br/>`004 KAdpAra -> (KAYjAraKAdiraKAparaKArkAra)`</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun <br/>`Why some are in () only?`  All suggestions whether in parens or no  are words in some dictionary that are <br/>   within a certain edit distance of the word in question (samudragupwa in case 001 of pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt).<br/>   samudragupta is a word in some dictionary which has a close spelling to samudragupwa  so <br/>   sumdragupta qualifies as a suggestion.   NOW  imagine we have a list of all suggestions *based on edit<br/>   distance* criterion.   This list is further analyzed into two sublists based on the preceding and succeeding<br/>   headword  (in case 001 of PGN  the preceding headword is candragupta and the following headword is<br/>   also candragupta -  unusual they are the same.)   If a given suggestion is alphabetically between the<br/>   preceeding and following headword then that suggestion goes in non-parenthesized list;  if the suggestion<br/>   fails to be alphabetically between then that suggestion goes in the parenthesized list.  <br/><br/>`Why some () are empty?`    There are no suggestions that are NOT in alphabetical order.  E.g. in case 003<br/>   there is just one suggestion Suklakarmman  and it is alphabetically between ruzwaSarmman and <br/>   suSarmman  so Suklakarmman   was put outside () and there was no other suggestion that could go in<br/>   ()<br/><br/>`Should we have such a big fuzzy distance?`   There is no easy answer to this question.  The edit-distance<br/>  maximum edit distance parameter used in the PGN fuzzyalpha.py program was 6.   This generates some<br/>  false positives (bad suggestions).    I don't know if there is a 'best' edit distance threshold. <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>There is two other details of the suggestion generation that is incorporated in fuzzyalpha.py.  <br/> Suppose that the fuzzy distance parameter is set to 6.   And suppose our base word is X (like samudragupwa <br/> is case 001 of PGN).  Our initial pool of candidates for suggestions Y is all 300000+ words in sanhw1.txt.<br/> <br/>* An accepted suggestion Y must have the same first letter as X  (e.g. Y must start with 's')<br/>* Once we have the set S of all words Y which have the same first letter as X and whose edit distance from<br/>   X is <=6  then this suggestion list is further reduced to include only those Y in S which have the minimum<br/>   edit distance from X.   To elaborate:  Suppose the edit distances from X happen to be 3 for some Y in S<br/>   4 for some other Y in S and 6 for other Y in S.   Then the FINAL suggestion list will only include those <br/>   Y with edit distance of 3.<br/><br/>The first condition was chosen to provide some computational efficiency.<br/><br/>The second condition was chosen as a way to prune the list of suggestions (so that list would not be too long).<br/><br/>These choices could be debated  but for our purposes in generating correction suggestions they seem to <br/>be plausible.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>I worked with two dictionary suggestions and the suggestions are very\nuseful overall. Lets keep them as they are.\nYhe parenthesis mystery also bothered me. Thanks for clarification.\n</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>1) `words in some dictionary` why not link to it? why not add info where it comes from? That can help in the decision making. Knowing the background helps at least me.<br/>2) ` suggestion is alphabetically between the preceeding and following headword then that suggestion goes in non-parenthesized list` I hope Dhaval got it because I hardly.<br/>3) `edit-distance maximum edit distance parameter used in the PGN fuzzyalpha.py program was 6` - can we recreate the files with 54321? 1 seems to give fine results see <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/45#issuecomment-92873646" target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/45#issuecomment-92873646</a><br/>4) `all 300000+ words in sanhw1.txt` -> all 430k. Feel the difference between 300 and 430k.<br/>5) `same first letter as X` - what about the a+X an+X (in the beginning of the word) variations should not we include them as well? Maybe PD dirt can be cleaned because of it?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun Re 5). PD<br/><br/>I've generated pd-fuzzyalpha  1158 cases.  Review of a random selection of these makes me think that<br/> THERE ARE ALMOST NO ERRORS.   Rather  I suspect these cases are simply due to the great number<br/>of compound words in PD that do not appear in MW.  Take `agnicEtanya` as an example.  Both `agni` and<br/>`cEtanya` are words appearing in MW but the compound word does not appear and the `icE` sequence<br/>appearing in this compound does not appear in any MW word.<br/><br/>I think a different approach should be used to examine this PD faultfinder list.  The reason is that 1158 cases<br/>is practically speaking a large list to check manually against scans.<br/><br/>One different approach would be for<br/>one of our Sanskrit experts simply to read each word in the list and judge whether the word is *obviously* a<br/>correct Sanskrit word (I suspect this will be true in 90% of the cases) or whether the word needs further<br/>examination.  Then the words marked for further examination can be examined 'manually' by comparison<br/>to the scanned images.<br/><br/>Another possible approach would be to write a program to identify  the words which are (like agnicEtanya)<br/>compounds of MW headwords.  Here's how the program could work. The program could successively try<br/>all 2-fold partitions of the word for instance <br/>a+gnicEtanya ag + nicEtanya agn+icEtanya agni+cEtanya agnic+Etanya  ... agnicEtany + a<br/>and for a given partition check if both components are MW headwords.  If so the given word would be<br/>marked as OK.   The remaining words (those not marked as OK) would need further review either by<br/>Sanskrit experts or manually by comparison to scan.<br/>Note: This mechanical partition is simple-minded that's why it would be a good first thing to try. One weakness of the mechanical partition approach is that it does not take into account sandhi that can occur<br/>in compounds when combining nominal stems.  For instance the word `akzIRendu` occurs among the <br/>1158 PD cases.  This is likely a compound of akzIRa and indu (both MW stems) but this fact would not<br/>be found by the mechanical partition approach.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim the non-appearance of `agnicEtanya` in MW is understood. PD initial goal was to list all the possible combinations MW wanted to keep the bricks separately so he has only `agni` and `cEtanya`. At the end of the day PD failed and the dictionary will be never finished. As a part of the initial goal in Pune I plan to print the total index of all the 430k wordforms found in Sanskrit dictionaries to see if it has any practical usage.<br/>1k+ cases is a list too big indeed just to test.<br/>`One different approach` does not makes sense - it would bring as to the Bronze Age (pre-2014). It would make sense only if @drdhaval2785 would create a sister to his sandhi generator and analyze the words and mark the ones which are fishy at least from the phonetics standpoint. <br/>`Another possible approach` seems to be more promising. The fact is such a program is already written and used at <a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/90.html#ciraprasuutaa" target="_blank">http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/90.html#ciraprasuutaa</a> In 2013 Gérard Huet wrote: `I know how to split arbitrary compounds. So the lexicalized entries do not matter that much except for looking up their definitions of course.`<br/>It's too bad Huet's code is closed he said it took them 6 months to make the `mechanical partition is simple-minded` process with Pawan Goyal a little more smarter. The sandhi part is rather stupid in Huet's splitting of samasas as well actually. This is where @drdhaval2785 or @mbykov code could come handy.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>These few cases have been
