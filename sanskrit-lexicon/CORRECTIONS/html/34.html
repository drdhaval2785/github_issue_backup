Exactly can be extended. It's a matter of Jim's time and priorities.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>In all dictionaries when there is Devanagari in the print edition it is coded in a distinguishable way. <br/><br/>In the case of VCP and SKD everything in text is  Devanagari.<br/><br/>So for these cases there are a lot of textual Sanskrit words amenable to spelling<br/>checks by faultfinder techniques.<br/><br/>When Sanskrit words are represented in some variant of IAST in the print edition then if the dictionary is MW these Sanskrit words also are identifiable as Sanskrit words because at some time in the past I marked them with the <br/>```<br/><as0> and <as1> tags.<br/>```<br/>However in the case of the other dictionaries the IAST Sanskrit is coded only as AS  (using letter-number combinations for diacritics).  There are difficulties in knowing if a given non-Devanagari word in a non-MW dictionary is a Sanskrit word or a word in some other language (English German).  So this is currently a hard case to handle.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim Can we test on a simple case like MW please to have the technique ready? Markup will come. Just follow the white rabbit.<br/><br/>MW 1899 : XXXII<br/>`<br/>As to the books used by myself many of them of course are identical with those named above. Others are named in the first edition and need not be referred to again here. I ought however to repeat that some of the words marked MW. in the present edition rest on the authority of the Åšabdakalpadruma <br/>`</p><hr/></body></html>
