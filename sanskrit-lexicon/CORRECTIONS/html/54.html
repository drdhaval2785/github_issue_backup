Now key2 is IAST in the AS coding. So if key2 is displayed as in the text it will be displayed as IAST key2 in AS coding is 'daus4cittya' and it should display in IAST as<br/>'dauścittya' . The error was in the 'O' of the display.<br/><br/>So there was a bug. The bug was in make_xml.py which makes the xml file used for the display.<br/><br/>The bug has been fixed so dauścittya is displayed.<br/><br/></p><hr/></body></html>
