Fuzzy does not recognize capital letters so I'm making my modification for coding / decoding. The list is ready:<br/>```<br/>A ä<br/>I ï<br/>U ü<br/>F ř<br/>X ľ<br/>E ë<br/>O ö<br/>M ň<br/>H ĥ<br/>K ķ<br/>G ģ<br/>N ŋ<br/>C č<br/>J ĵ<br/>Y ñ<br/>W ṭ<br/>Q ţ<br/>R ṇ<br/>T ŧ<br/>D đ<br/>P þ<br/>B ƅ<br/>S š<br/>```<br/><br/>It's something that might be less fruitful than CVC doing so I'll wait for now.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Regarding 4: Pattern matching on string length.<br/><br/>This is the topic of N-grams.   Shingling and n-grams are similar I think after looking at @gasyoun 's reference.   The main difference is that with n-grams you are looking at sequences of characters in a character string while with shingles you are looking at sequences of 'tokens'  (e.g. of words).<br/><br/>@gasyoun   Your 'fuzzy' approach is still 'fuzzy' to me although I understand the basic 'edit distance' idea of string comparison.  The approach might be more widely usable if like the faultfinder tactic it were developed into a program.  Perhaps you and Dhaval are already developing such a program?<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim my fuzzy is an addon to Excel (<a href="https://www.ablebits.com/excel-suite/)" target="_blank">https://www.ablebits.com/excel-suite/)</a> and so will remain.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun <br/>Jim and I are interested in the documentation of logic and execution of your fuzzy.

We will have noun-endings and verb-endings too which are not there in headwords. So we will have to figure out a way to tackle them.<br/>```</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>```<br/>6 listing out impossible letter combinations by Sanskrit grammar rules<br/>```</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Yeah 6 is my long wanted idea of non-sandhi patterns.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>```<br/>7 Taking English-Sanskrit dictionaries as base and clustering the Sanskrit words having same meaning.
