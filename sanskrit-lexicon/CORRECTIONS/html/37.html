As per my experience such a mode is not easy to operate with but sorted right can be of great help.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Yes I agree it is not very usefult to sort by pattern.<br/>Let me see if I can sort it with dictionaries.<br/>If yes - it would be great.<br/>But preliminary output showed that there are years to go before we exhaust the faultfinder technique and invent some other technique.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>As mentioned by Gasyoun the data is sorted dictionary wise now.<br/>Available [here](<a href="http://drdhaval2785.github.io/dictionarywiseerrors.html)." target="_blank">http://drdhaval2785.github.io/dictionarywiseerrors.html).</a><br/>Beware. Around 19 MB data.<br/>So browser may freeze for some time.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>As it becomes difficult to keep track of dictionary corrections here I will be submitting corrections dictionary wise in separate thread.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785   We have issues of efficiency for you in finding candidates and issues of efficiency for me in processing candidates.  For me it is more efficient to process a bunch for one dictionary as you've been presenting them thus far. <br/><br/>You could (such as by making use of sanhw1.txt instead of the separate Xslp.txt files) compare say MW to ALL other dictionaries -  Not sure whether you've already done this.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I just now updated sanhw1.zip at <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29859999/sanhw1.zip" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29859999/sanhw1.zip</a></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Downloaded `sanhw1.zip` but I guess we should keep it in one place. Because the 1st release was in another thread and people might end using the older one instead of this. What sorting method is used in `sanhw1.zip`?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun   Sorting order is Sanskrit alphabetical ordering (the lexicographical ordering that I use<br/>based on ordering aAiIuUfFxXeEoOMHkKgGNcCjJYwWqQRtTdDnpPbBmyrlvSzsh  of sanskrit alphabet<br/>in slp1)<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>The order you used seems fine when the convention of changing M to paYcama varga letter is followed.<br/>e.g. kaNkaRa कङ्कण. <br/>But it fails when the dictionary uses kaMkaRa कंकण.<br/><br/>It should sort at the place of kaNkaRa - even if it is spelt as kaMkaRa.<br/>Hope I am clear.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim I would propose you integrate Dhaval's approach. </p><hr/></body></html>
