Normally in MW ~ is used as a 'space' character<br/>    this is a holdover from a coding convention in Malten's Monier.all.<br/>    However in the current SLP1 ~ is used to indicate candra-bindu.<br/>    This appears in key2 for one word (key1=sArisTAKA key2=sArisTA-KA~);<br/>    As far as is known this is the only use of ~ in Sanskrit-SLP1 in <br/>    mw.xml.  Thus we change this global replacement in all of $line<br/>    to deal just with the $body.<br/> $line = preg_replace('/~/'' '$line);<br/> */<br/> if (preg_match('|^(.*)(<body>.*</body>)(.*)$|'$line$matches)){<br/>  $head = $matches[1];<br/>  $body = $matches[2];<br/>  $tail = $matches[3];<br/>  $body = preg_replace('/~/'' '$body);<br/>  $line = $head . $body . $tail;<br/> }<br/>```<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>re '~' in PWG:<br/>in pwg.xml a '~' occurs in 577 records.<br/>Most of these occur in forms VOWEL+M+~  and these would be candidates for changing to VOWEL+~.<br/>  I want to confirm with Peter whether M~ is redundant in SLP1 and if so will make the change.<br/>As is common when the other cases are examined  it's like turning over a rock in the woods -- various<br/>obscure creatures crawl out!<br/>For instance there are a few cases where ~ has been used for an mdash = &mdash;  (long dash). One<br/>of these occurs under headword anapAya and in anapAya one sees &lt;NV&gt; -  what the heck is that?  There<br/>are 21 cases of &lt;NV&gt;  Based on the anapAya example and a vague memory of a comment from Thomas I think &lt;NV&gt;xxx&lt;/NV&gt; is from a source of 'corrigendum' material that Thomas started to insert but then didn't finish; the last one in pwg.txt is <br/>```<br/><H1>000{antaHpArSvya}1{antaHpArSvya/}¦ (von {#antar + pArSva#}) •adj.<br/><NV>{%an den Seiten befindlich%} st.</NV> = {#antaHparSavya#} ¯{¤VS. 39 9.¤}<br/>```<br/>If so perhaps these NV sections (which at least in case anapAya are definitely not in the body of the print) should also be removed.<br/><br/>There is actually an email comment from Thomas of Dec 15 2011 as follows:<br/>```<br/>tag <NV> (N=Nachträge=additions V=Verbesserungen=corrections) is a first feeble attempt to <br/>integrate the very extensive additions and corrections added by Boehtlingk himself to pwg. <br/>I think they can be deleted because there are now better ways to handle these additions <br/>(similarly to the Halle and Schmidt complex I think)<br/>```<br/>So Thomas would be in favor of removing these. Maybe I should go ahead and delete these and put <br/>the old versions as an NV.txt file under PWG in Corrections repository.  <br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>You must have been an inspector or detective before we met. disp.php is great but for my .indd file I'll use .xml so it does not solves a thing actually. As per `whether M~ is redundant in SLP1 and if so will make the change.` - Peter has to agree or change his documentation. `'corrigendum' material that Thomas started to insert but then didn't finish` is where it gets interesting. `(which at least in case anapAya are definitely not in the body of the print) should also be removed` - if not removed at least marked as such that are not in the print. So nobody would have to solve the puzzle without any clues. What is `Halle` complex in Thomas' email is interesting no idea. Removing these does not sounds a good idea as well - it's at least a start even if abandoned. The only issue is to have a list of such abandoned starts.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>For our information here is my email question to Peter regarding M~ and his response:<br/>```<br/>Peter -<br/> In PWG there are 577 records of pwg.xml in which the current coding of Devanagari in SLP1 includes <br/>a ~.  In almost all of these the form is VOWEL+M+~.   Is the form M~ redundant in SLP1 i.e. should <br/>all of these cases be changed to VOWEL+~ ?<br/> Incidentally why is candra-bindu used at all - does it represent a different pronunciation than M? <br/>Why is it absent from the usual listing of the Devanagari alphabet?<br/>```<br/><br/>```<br/>Dear Jim<br/>\M~\ is not meaningful in SLP1.  'M' indicates anusvAra; '~' indicates nasalization which does not apply to <br/>anusvAra since anusvAra is already a nasal sound.<br/>I believe the endoding \M~\ is a relic of Thomas' original encoding which distinguished bindu from candra <br/>bindu.  In SKD at least bindu was encoded as M and candrabindu as MM.  We should check whether \M~\ <br/>represents candrabindu as MM did in SKD.<br/>Now the use of bindu and candrabindu in Devanagari Vedic texts varies so it is not clear what the phonetic <br/>significance is without some further investigation.  When it occurs above a vowel or semivowel y l or v <br/>candra bindu represents nasalization of the vowel or semivowel.  If candrabindu occurs with a virama (or <br/>avagraha) below it it indicates an anusvAra.  Many texts use bindu for an anusvAra that is susceptible to <br/>being replaced by a stop homorganic with the following stop e.g. vanaM gacCati could become by sandhi <br/>vanaN gacCati but contrast this with a 'true' anusvAra which only occurs before spirants (S z s h) and r <br/>e.g. vanaM sarati vanaM rocate.  If the use of M~ is consistent according to the above contexts it may be <br/>possible to accurately transcode the 'M~' to either 'M' or '~' depending upon that context.<br/>```<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I think that 'M~' in pwg.txt always occurs due to my conversion of Thomas's  MM which he used to<br/>represent candra-bindu in his version of HK transliteration.<br/><br/>According to Peter's reply the transformation of candra-bindu MM to M~ is incorrect and MM should be<br/>changed to ~.  Unless anyone can see a reason otherwise  I'll make that change. to PWG.<br/><br/>I think Peter's long 3rd paragraph has no direct bearing on such a change.   Although I found the comment <br/>on 'true' anusvAra interesting as provides an explanation of why for instance saMsAra is so spelled rather<br/>than being spelled as samsAra.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>~ does not makes much sense but let it be - it's better than that inconsistency what we have now. If I were to choose between `transcode the 'M~' to either 'M' or '~'` I would go for 'M'. Or do we use M for the anusvara and should not add a second meaning?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun 'Halle complex'  :  A group at Halle University worked with Thomas (and me)  in 2010/11 to 'add' some other texts (sort of like Schmidt) which in some sense supplement  Boehtlingk.  <br/>For an example see <a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWScan/halleSample2/disp/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWScan/halleSample2/disp/index.php</a><br/>and enter kfzRa.<br/>This data is not public as far as I know; <br/>if you wanted to get this you would need to contact members of the project at<br/>Halle.  I can email Thomas for a contact for Halle if you wish to pursue this.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun  re ~ and M.  I think the answer has to do with finer points of SLP1.  To have pwg Devanagari coded in conformance with SLP1  we should use ~ for candrabindu and M for anusvAra.  That's my understanding.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim let it be as you say. not found: kfzRa - so sure I would want to send an email to Halle. In 2006 I even received scans of books from Halle so there is a strong old school of Indology scholars.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun Be sure to change to SLP1 then look up word 'kfzRa'.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Re M~.  I went ahead and changed the M~ to ~.  This was done by a change to the hk_slp1.xml transcoder<br/>file in convertwork directory; so the change is visibile in pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt.  Also had to slightly adjust some of the subsequent manualByLine##_slp1.txt input files so that subsequent updates would work.<br/><br/>@drdhaval2785  I think it is safe to close this issue now and am doing so.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Also Removed the &lt;NV&gt; cases (21) in PWG.<br/>The old data is in [removenv_all.txt](<a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PWG/removenv_all.txt)." target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PWG/removenv_all.txt).</a><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Great. Conclusively ended the thread. Happy.\n</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Made the same correction of MM (HK) -> ~ (SLP1) for dictionaries PWG (already mentioned) and<br/>SKD AP AP90 PW VCP.  Not currently aware of other dictionaries requiring back-correction.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>MM is more self evident but it's good to have a uniform standard. If Peter says ~ so be it. Thanks Jim.</p><hr/></body></html>
