Regarding `Ai` or `e` - which of these entries exactly do you mean?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>The first entry A-i </p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>In key2 we would have `A-i` so no issue. But in key1 - yeah looks ugly :) Still we have to maintain it as it is.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>The entries should remain as they are.  Usually MW has the 'sandhi' form of the headword as separate entries. <br/><br/>These are informally classified by me as &lt;see&gt; entries - meaning that they are 'extra' entries that for one reason or another MW added to the dictionary; however they only point to other entries the 'body' of the entries only contain information 'see X'.<br/><br/>In the spirit of Marcis's Linnaean classification of all headwords in MW  it would probably be an improvement to develop some incremental markup that would readily identify these and other 'pseudo-entries'.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Sure this will solve the unmarked word issue all these `see` kind of entries only need to check first if there are any false positives.</p><hr/></body></html>
