Please tell me. Like if we wanted to compile a list of changes and printed book page numbers for example.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>For MW there is a fairly complete list of cases where we 'fixed' the text (i.e. made a change to mw.xml that purposely differs from the text).  This list is now uploaded <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/blob/master/corrections-factual.txt." target="_blank">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/blob/master/corrections-factual.txt.</a><br/><br/>There is currently no similar file for any other dictionary. Except possibly for SKD I don't think we've thus far intentionally made changes that disagree with scans in other dictionaries than MW.  <br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim Right so MW is documented SKD is a candidate for future got it. My fuzzy list does contains a few non-MW and non-SKD but not that many. But maybe that would be the right time to track them. What algorithm did you use before just backed up from the big changelog manually those that are factual?<br/>1) Perfect list thanks. Never seen before.<br/>2) Too bad many do not have a date some do not have an author as well.<br/>3) When I read `See updlogs/log_20140413-01.txt` how should I understand it?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Great to see everything so well documented. <br/>Learning many things in the process.<br/>Now that it is known that Jim keeps log of such errors also let's treat this issue as closed. :)</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Re method:  The corrections_factual file is maintained manually.<br/><br/>Re 2) dates -  Would be difficult (probably not impossible) to retrieve from old updlogs/ files.  I just didn't think to put dates until sometime along in the process.<br/><br/>Re 3) - log file:  This is a file containing the 'new' version of the data for changes to MW.  The particular file exists in the Cologne file system.
