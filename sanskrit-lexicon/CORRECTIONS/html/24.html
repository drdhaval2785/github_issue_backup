If MW would want to have suffixes marked up in some way than these are left out. And our duty would be to fix it. It's not right. Even if that is in such a manner in the printed book - it's illogical compared to the rest of the book.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Regarding 'If you look at the small - at the start of -tta it would mean that it is only a suffix kind of thing. <br/>So I opine that it should be level 2.'<br/><br/>The governing principal for assigning 'H1'...'H4' to elements is drawn from the Preface to MW (see <a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csldoc/dictionaries/prefaces/mwpref/mwpref11.html):" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csldoc/dictionaries/prefaces/mwpref/mwpref11.html):</a><br/><br/>![image](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/4817243/eee91e06-5ee6-11e4-94ed-3a2d4ee4901e.png)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/4817243/eee91e06-5ee6-11e4-94ed-3a2d4ee4901e.png)</a><br/><br/>Thus the only the fact about the headword tta that is used in assigning it  'H1' is that the headword is in Devanagari type; the fact that there is a leading '-' before the IAST form of this headword is not used in deciding which H-code to assign.<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>So that means that the Nagari is there by error. It should not be H1. MW or the printer in Oxford made a mistake. Wonder what Peter would say about it.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim Taking into consideration that this is THE ONLY entry having - at start in H1 it is certain that this is MW error in print.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim please please have a look at this point. Only a single correction. We can settle and move on.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>Instead of double posts I would propose you make a top 10 list of entries you would want Jim to look at. I've made mine and emailed to him months ago. Not sure if it works but still makes more sense.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.<br/><br/>This reminds me of one of @gasyoun 's comments (who knows where it was) regarding markup that there should be  a 'Linnaean' classification of  all the records of MW.  This pair is so odd (not being words at all but just suffixes) that it begs for some markup that indicates the nature of the oddity.  There are other headwords we've come across in recent memory (such as AIkz in MW) which are also odd in some way.  For many purposes (e.g. MWlexnorm) such odd records should be ignored.   And this is not just an issue with MW.<br/><br/>So maybe a constructive thing to do would be to come up with some ideas regarding markup for our pals -tta -tti and their shady friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>There are more than 300 suffixes in MW. ` -tta -tti ` are not shady but wrong. Would want to know what Peter thinks about them. Occam's razor does not allows and makes no sense in introducing new elements where there is no need for them.<br/>UPD. Peter wrote:<br/>`Since tta and tti are respectively dA + ta and dA + ti they are equally derivates of the root dA.  If MW were consistent he should have made both level 2 headwords in Roman and listed these under the root dA.  But because they don't begin with 'd' so are far from their parent he listed them separately  in alphabetic order instead of as derivates of dA and put them as shown with the first as a main headword and the second as a related word.`<br/>And `Well it IS consistent as Jim pointed out because the tta entry is in Devanagari.  Roman headwords are always subordinate to a preceding Devanagari headword.  If we make tta Roman they will be improperly subordinated to the preceding Devanagari word.  On the other hand now that this is a digital dictionary alphabetic order has little relevance and we could just subordinate these words in our hierarchical list to dA1 'give' and tta also to dA3 'cut'.<br/>I would let Jim and Thomas decide which way to go.`</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>```<br/>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.<br/>```<br/>I still hold that this is an error in MW and not an intentional thing.<br/>You are the best judge to adjudge the matter on basis of the material laid before you.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>The `tta` entry should not have been in Devanagari. That is a print error. And it is not because it's a \digital dictionary alphabetic order has little relevance\ and no need to \just subordinate these words in our hierarchical list to dA1 'give' and tta also to dA3 'cut'\ - that would bee too drastic even for me.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Subordinating to dA is the most drastic thing to do.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim it's time to close it. But first a final decision has to be made. My Dec22 comment is still what I believe and what is too drastic remains so.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I don't see an obvious thing to do.<br/><br/>Leave issue open until a definite solution is found or until the problem is viewed as too minor to worry about.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>If I have to manually clean (and I do) this item when compiling a new edition of my Reverse dictionary I can't stay calm until this case is settled. Wonder what other users of MW would say let me ask them per email.</p><hr/></body></html>
