<h1><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/28" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/repos/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/28</a></h1><hr/><h2>Title - Slide python over all dictionaries</h2><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim <br/>I verified that PWG has now vowel-M-accent changed to vowel-accent-M.<br/>Similar for visarga (H).<br/><br/>But I think still other dictionaries may have it because code used for generation was the same.<br/>For test case I tried <a href=\<a href="https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/blob/master/HeadwordLists/CCS-unique-key2-29317.txt\" target="_blank">https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/blob/master/HeadwordLists/CCS-unique-key2-29317.txt\</a>>CCS-key2</a>. <br/>It had the same issue as PWG had.<br/>e.g. aM/Sa aM/satra etc.<br/><br/>Q1. For generic errors - do we slide the python over other dictionaries as well ?<br/>Q2. If not wouldn't it be a good idea to correct other dictionaries also?<br/><br/>@gasyoun  and @Shalu411 what do you think about it ?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@drdhaval2785  CCS is very dirty. I've read a few pages of it and every page contains plenty of OCR errors. There are many non-SLP1 dictionaries so the accents in all of them are non-standard with MW PWG PWK. I think we need to get there in 1-2 years from now</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun I really don't intend to draw attention to the quality of file. All I want to draw attention to is - if there is generic error correct in all dictionaries.<br/><br/>I don't want someone to submit the same correction to CCS or any other dictionaries after 5 years which Jim and we are already aware of NOW.<br/><br/>Let's stop reinventing the wheel and do other fruitful work.<br/><br/>What say @funderburkjim ?<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Applied change to PW:  246 lines changed.  Acc. to pw-meta.txt PW uses ª for udAtta ªª for svarita.  I don't think there are any anudAtta codes in PW (at least the PWG anudAtta symbol ¸ does not appear in PW.)<br/><br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Applied change to CCS: 76 lines changed.  CCS convention seems same as PW (udAtta svarita but no anudAtta).<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>In SCH this is not an issue since Schmidt doesn't use Devanagari. IAST is coded as AS where '4' following a vowel is udAtta.  There are no 'M4' or 'H4'.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>In SCH 4 is not good do you agree. Can we make it /? </p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I noticed in PWG that our changes were ugly when viewed in Devanagari with 'Show Accents' in the cases like 'a/MSa'.<br/><br/>Made an odd change to slp1_deval.xml  (transcoder file) so now they are pretty again.<br/><br/>Made similar changes for PW and CCS.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>re: In SCH 4 is not good do you agree. Can we make it /?  <br/> <br/>4 is commonly used as 'acute accent after previous letter' when the digitizations use AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) to code IAST.   The thing about the AS coding is that the language of the word being coded is not specified:  It could be Sanskrit (then we would say that the scan has IAST and the digitization is coding it using the AS encoding).  But it could apriori be French or Slavic or who knows what.  <br/><br/>Thus I think we should not now change the 4 to / in Schmidt. <br/><br/>If at some future time we identify that all the AS coding in Schmidt is indeed coding Sanskrit words that appear as IAST in the scan  then we could safely recode the AS in some way more amenable to Sanskrit.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>At the moment I don't know any other dictionaries where the 'a/MSa' issue arises.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/drdhaval2785' target='_blank'>drdhaval2785</a> :</b><br/><p>Great</p><hr/></body></html>
