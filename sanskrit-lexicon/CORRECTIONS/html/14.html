But are the 2 additional pages from the 1960 reprint as well? I checked a few and did not notice the changes. Otherwise `asOnAman` should be deleted or at least marked for deletion right?<br/><br/>![asau](<a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/4638106/8aa6f4aa-53f5-11e4-83af-80fcdb36d251.PNG)" target="_blank">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/4638106/8aa6f4aa-53f5-11e4-83af-80fcdb36d251.PNG)</a><br/><br/>P.S. <a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csldoc/dictionaries/prefaces/mwpref.html" target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csldoc/dictionaries/prefaces/mwpref.html</a> abbreviation page missing (because pages 2-6 of mw_bookmark.pdf are left out).</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim question remains open about MW.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>@gasyoun What do you suggest be done?<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim is my suggestion right? Are supplements integrated?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>Yes -  but I am not sure whether you have discovered some further supplement pages that were not included among the supplements that have been integrated. <br/>The supplement pages that were integrated can be seen [here](<a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=pdf)." target="_blank">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=pdf).</a><br/><br/>Are the supplements from your archive.org reference included in these Cologne images?<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim supplements you linked to are part of the original book. Supplements I talked about were supplements of supplements - 2 pages (Addenda et Corrigenda) in the beginning of the newest edition. I could not trace it's implementation on a single example.<br/><a href="https://archive.org/stream/sanskritenglishd00moniuoft#page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank">https://archive.org/stream/sanskritenglishd00moniuoft#page/n5/mode/2up</a><br/><a href="https://archive.org/stream/sanskritenglishd00moniuoft#page/n7/mode/2up" target="_blank">https://archive.org/stream/sanskritenglishd00moniuoft#page/n7/mode/2up</a><br/>If Addenda et Corrigenda would have been implemented there would be an entry called `brih` and no `barh` entry or at least interlinked.</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>These pages from archive.org definitely do NOT appear among the scanned images for MW at Cologne.<br/><br/>And these pages from archive.org are not part of the material received from Thomas in 2010 as additions<br/>which refer only to the material at the end of the book.<br/><br/>So AFAIK there is no digitization of these archive.org pages.<br/></p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/gasyoun' target='_blank'>gasyoun</a> :</b><br/><p>@funderburkjim do you think we should ask Thomas about necessity of it's inclusion?</p><hr/><b><a href='https://github.com/funderburkjim' target='_blank'>funderburkjim</a> :</b><br/><p>I've sent email question to Thomas.</p><hr/></body></html>
