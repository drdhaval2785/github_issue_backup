1. Right now only \r\n is treated, but users having \n or \r only should also get good <br/> facility.
2. Github allows linking to the number of issue e.g. #74 would have a link to <a href="https://github.com/UserName/RepoName/issue/74" target="_blank">#74</a>
3. Issue closed by XYZ has a specific red round with username associated in Github. This should be replicated.
4. The browser interprets the data inside a codeline, which it shouldn't. 
e.g. "Nothing big, but Parsedown creates <code><br/></code> tags which don't work in certain ancient browsers."
is not rendered well. The broser interprets <br/> and <br /> which it shouldn't.
5. Blockqoutes issue. The blockquote should end at the end of line character.
e.g. "> Explicit is better than implicit.\r\n\r\nI find this to be a bit subjective. Should I also add a sentence that describes what PHP is? I'm not saying that the request is bad. I'm saying that I'd need a better reason than that."
should render
Explicit is better than implicit in blockquotes
and 
the next line outside blockquotes.
6. Smiley and Emoticon support
7. \"Shouldn't we correct the existing CCS digitization first?\" in body gives 
\Shouldn't we correct the existing CCS digitization first?\
whereas it should give 
"Shouldn't we correct the existing CCS digitization first?"
8. Fenced code not working well. For examples see file:///E:/C_drive/xampp/htdocs/drdhaval2785.github.io/github_issue_backup/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/html/56.html
9. Open / Closed issue should have some tag somewhere showing its status.
